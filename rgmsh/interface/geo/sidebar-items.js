initSidebarItems({"fn":[["add_curve_loop","Add a curve loop (a closed wire) formed by the curves `curveTags`. `curveTags` should contain (signed) tags of model enties of dimension 1 forming a closed loop: a negative tag signifies that the underlying curve is considered with reversed orientation. If `tag` is positive, set the tag explicitly; otherwise a new tag is selected automatically. Return the tag of the curve loop."],["add_line","Add a straight line segment between the two points with tags `startTag` and `endTag`. If `tag` is positive, set the tag explicitly; otherwise a new tag is selected automatically. Return the tag of the line."],["add_plane_surface","Add a plane surface defined by one or more curve loops `wireTags`. The first curve loop defines the exterior contour; additional curve loop define holes. If `tag` is positive, set the tag explicitly; otherwise a new tag is selected automatically. Return the tag of the surface."],["add_point","Add a geometrical point in the built-in CAD representation, at coordinates (`x`, `y`, `z`). If `meshSize` is > 0, add a meshing constraint at that point. If `tag` is positive, set the tag explicitly; otherwise a new tag is selected automatically. Return the tag of the point. (Note that the point will be added in the current model only after `synchronize` is called. This behavior holds for all the entities added in the geo module.)"],["remove_point","Remove the entities `dimTags`. If `recursive` is true, remove all the entities on their boundaries, down to dimension 0."],["synchronize","Synchronize the built-in CAD representation with the current Gmsh model. This can be called at any time, but since it involves a non trivial amount of processing, the number of synchronization points should normally be minimized."]]});
